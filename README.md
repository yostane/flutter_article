# Welcome to Flutter development

Once upon a time, on February 27 2018, Google annoucend the first beta of a new mobile development technology named [Flutter](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/02/announcing-flutter-beta-1.html). It is gaining more and more attention and even some developers published apps relying on a beta version of Flutter.

This article tries to give you a glimpse of Flutter. Without further dues, let's get going :steam_locomotive:.

## Introduction

[Flutter](https://flutter.io) is a new technology that allows to make native iOS and Android apps using a single code base. In fact, we write a single programs with the [Dart programming language](https://www.dartlang.org/) and get as a result a native iOS app and as well as a native an Android. This is possible because Dart code is [compiled into native code](https://flutter.io/faq/#run-android). What's more interesting though is that UI view are not translated into their native couternpart (as opposed to [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/)). Instead, it has its own 2D rendering engine that renders the views (which are called widgets as we'll see later) very efficiently.

## Main concepts

In order to develop apps using Flutter,

### Flutter technical stack

### Dart programming language

(Dart, technical stack)

## Building the UI

(rendering engine, state, widgets)

As written earlier, Flutter has its own rendering engine. This has the advantage of not depending on platform specific views, but it requires that any view needs to be implemented in Dart before using it. Hopefully, many UI Widgets are already available and allow to create very beautiful and smooth UI.
